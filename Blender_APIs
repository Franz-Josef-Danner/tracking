# Blender Motion Tracking APIs

# Marker access
# Retrieve markers from a track under the clip.tracking object
# Marker positions are stored in MovieTrackingMarker.co in normalized clip coordinates

# Pattern and search areas for a track
# Stored as two (x, y) coordinate pairs defining a rectangle around the marker center
# track.pattern_area = ((x1, y1), (x2, y2))
# track.search_area = ((x1, y1), (x2, y2))

# Example usage
# clip = bpy.data.movieclips["YourClip"]
# track = clip.tracking.tracks["YourTrack"]
# for marker in track.markers:
#     print(marker.co)
# print("Pattern:", track.pattern_area)
# print("Search:", track.search_area)
